# Challenge 05 Submission

## Overview 

### User Story:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


### Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


### Actual Behavior:

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Code uses Day.js library to work with data and time.
